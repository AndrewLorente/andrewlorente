      <p>I am a veteran developer with a focus in sustainable, maintainable program design. I am particularly interested in web development and unit testing.</p>

      <h3>SKILLSET</h3>
      <p>I have extensive experience in server-side web development. Most recently, I've been using a lot of Ruby and Haskell, but I am fluent and up-to-date on Python and JavaScript as well. I love git, test-driven development, and reproducible configurations.</p>
      <h4>Technologies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I've used an array of web frameworks, from the full-featured (Rails, Django) to the lightweight (Mason, Flask, Snap, Node).</li>
        <li>In the browser, I'm familiar with JQuery and Underscore; I can work without them as well.</li>
        <li>My database of choice is Postgresql, but I've used Redis for caching and queueing and Zookeeper for live configuration.</li>
        <li>I've worked extensively with AWS services, particularly S3, EC2, Cloudfront, SES, and Route53.</li>
        <li>One of the first things I look for when learning a new language is a test framework. To that end, I've used Ruby's Rspec, Mocha, and Minitest, Python's Nosetools and Mock, and Haskell's HUnit and Quickcheck.</li>
        <li>I provision my servers with configuration tools like Vagrant and Puppet, and deployment tools like Fabric and Capistrano.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>

      <h4>Particular accomplishments</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Built out our "native API," a set of extensively-customer-configurable API endpoints for use by our native SDKs.</li>

        <li>"Vagrantized" several projects with intricate, undocumented setup requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h4>Rentrak</h4>
      <h5>Software Developer, Team Lead, July 2007—April 2011</h5>
      <p>I was responsible for development and maintenance of our core software suite. Starting as a junior developer, I ended up a team lead&#8212;part of the leadership group for our flagship product.</p>
      <h4>Particular accomplishments</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Co-developed our Internet TV Essentials product, which analyzes usage data from millions of users around the world for sites like hulu and abc.com.</li>
        <li>Developed a general data-summarization framework used by many of our data-warehousing products.</li>
        <li>Made significant performance improvements to our test framework, by an order of magnitude in some cases.</li>
        <li>Extended our test-data setup systems, allowing dramatically faster development and improving readability.</li>
        <li>Developed custom PostgreSQL aggregates, allowing granular scrutiny of enormous amounts of data while conserving disk space.</li>
        <li>Developed a system for projecting users&#8217; future usage patterns.</li>

      <h3>VOLUNTEER WORK</h3>
      <h4>Code Scouts</h4>
      <h5>Mentor, May 2013-Present</h5>
      <p>Code Scouts is a nonprofit organization aimed at providing learning resources and mentoring to women in technology. As a mentor I work with members to help them find learning projects, develop working code, and prepare for interviews.</p>
