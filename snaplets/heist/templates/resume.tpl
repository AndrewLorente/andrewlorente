      <p>I am a veteran developer with a focus in sustainable, maintainable program design. I am primarily interested in web development and unit testing.</p>

      <h3>SKILLSET</h3>
      <p>I have extensive experience in server-side web development. Most recently, I've been using a lot of Ruby and Haskell, but I am fluent and up-to-date on Python and JavaScript as well. I love git, test-driven development, and reproducible configurations.</p>
      <h4>Technologies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I've used an array of web frameworks, from the full-featured (Rails, Django) to the lightweight (Mason, Flask, Snap, Node).</li>
        <li>In the browser, I'm familiar with JQuery and Underscore; I can work without them as well.</li>
        <li>My database of choice is Postgresql, but I've used Redis for caching and queueing and Zookeeper for live configuration.</li>
        <li>I've worked extensively with AWS services, particularly S3, EC2, Cloudfront, SES, and Route53.</li>
        <li>One of the first things I look for when learning a new language is a test framework. To that end, I've used Ruby's Rspec, Mocha, and Minitest, Python's Nosetools and Mock, and Haskell's HUnit and Quickcheck.</li>
        <li>Although server configuration isn't my forte, when I do it I do it right, with configuration tools like Vagrant and Puppet, and deployment tools like Fabric and Capistrano.</li>
      </ul>
